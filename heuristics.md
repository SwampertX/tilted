# Heuristics used for motion detection

## Tilt Left/Right

Taking the angle between the line the eyes made and the (horizon, or shoulder)

## Tilt Up

Eyes almost level with nose.

## Tilt Down

Nose close to shoulder blade. (and eyes will also be almost level with nose too)

## Turn Left/Right

- One eye (the direction turned to) is almost vertical with nose.
- Ear-nose distance increased.

## Head Rotation

Nose travels in circle.

## Shoulder Rolls

Shoulder width increases and decreases in a periodic manner, possibly similar to sin (or neg sin)
function due to circular motion, for forward/backward rolls respectively.
